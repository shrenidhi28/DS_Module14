## AIM:
To write a C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm.
## Algorithm
1.Start with process, burst time, and waiting time arrays.
2.Loop through each process from i = 0 to n-1.
3.Compute tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i].
4.End the algorithm.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find and display the priority of the operator in the given Postfix expression
Developed by: C.Shrenidhi
RegisterNumber:  212223040196
*/

int turnaroundtime( int proc[], int n,int burst_time[], int wait_time[], int tat[]) {
// calculating turnaround time by adding
// burst_time[i] + wait_time[i]
int i;
for ( i = 0; i < n ; i++)
tat[i] = burst_time[i] + wait_time[i];
return 0;
}

```

## Result:
Thus, the C function to calculate the turnaround time of each process given their burst time and waiting time in First Come first Serve scheduling algorithm is implemented successfully.
